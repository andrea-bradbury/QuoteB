# QuoteB
An app collecting user's quotes and store to JSON file. Adding an additional screen for favourites to be viewed.


Adaption of QuoteA with the  below changes:
• Add a boolean “favourite” property to your quote class. By default, it should be set to false.
• Next to where the random quote appears, add a toggle. It should be on if the quote is one of the favourites, and off if not. Tapping the button swaps back and forth.
• Add a button labeled “Favourites” that takes the user to a second screen that lists their favourites.
• The favourites screen should list up to ten favourites. If the user has more than ten, they should be selected randomly.
• The favourite screen should have a “back” button to return to the main screen.
